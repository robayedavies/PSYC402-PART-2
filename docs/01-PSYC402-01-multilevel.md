# PSYC402 Part 2 Week 16

## Welcome

Welcome to your overview of the materials and guidance you will work with in **PSYC402 Week 16**.

## Resources for you

You will see -- below -- links to the lectures, information about the data we will analyze, and an explanation of the activities.

The links and everything you need for your practical work class can *also* be found in the **Week 16 files** folder on Moodle, here:

## Lectures: video recordings

The lecture material for this week is presented in three parts.
Click on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the *Panopto* video for the lecture part.
(You will need to be on campus or logged in to the university VPN to get access to the videos.)

[Part 1 of 3](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=66e89421-4491-4eb9-b1c8-acd4012a183d){target="_blank"}

## Readings

I have written a textbook chapter to support PSYC402 students learning about multilevel models.

You can download the chapter here [01-multilevel.pdf](files/week-16/01-multilevel.pdf).

## Pre-lab activity 1: Get your files ready for the lab class

Download the [01-multilevel.zip](files/week-16/01-multilevel.zip) files you need and upload them to RStudio Server.

The folder includes the data file:

- `BAFACALO_DATASET.RData`

and code file:

- `402-01-multilevel-workbook.R`

You will use `402-01-multilevel-workbook.R` in the lab activity.

## Lab activity

### What is in the activity .R file?

We will take things step-by-step.
We will split .R scripts into parts, tasks and questions:  

- different parts for different phases of the analysis workflow;
- different tasks for different steps in each phase;
- different questions to examine different ideas or coding steps.

### Tasks

In the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks.

### What is in the data files
