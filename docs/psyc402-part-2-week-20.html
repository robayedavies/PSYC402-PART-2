<p>Welcome to our overview of the materials and guidance you will work with in <strong>PSYC402 Week 20</strong> for the <strong>04-glmm</strong> class.</p>
<!-- As we saw in the **Introduction to mixed-effects models** (for the `02-mixed` class), many Psychologists conduct studies where it is not sensible to think of observations as being nested (Baayen, Davidson, \& Bates, 2008).  -->
<!-- We shall work with the **ML word recognition study** dataset, which has a structure similar to the CP study data that we worked with previously. -->
<!-- Again, the core concern is that the data come from a study with a **repeated-measures design** where the experimenter presented multiple stimuli for response to each participant, for several participants, so that we have multiple observations for each participant and multiple observations for each stimulus. -->
<!-- Getting practice with this kind of data will help you to easily recognize what you have got when you see it in your own work. -->
<!-- We shall analyse the outcome variable in relation to: -->
<!-- \begin{description} -->
<!-- \item[fixed effects] -->
<!-- the impact of independent variables like participant reading skill or word frequency -->
<!-- \item[random effects] -->
<!-- the impact of random or unexplained differences between participants and also between stimuli -->
<!-- \end{description} -->
<!-- In this webpage, I extract and present an outline taster summary (a little re-ordered) of a second chapter written for the course. -->
<!-- Please go to the chapter for the authoritative version of the full text: [03-mixed.pdf](files/week-19/03-mixed.pdf). -->
<!-- ### Introductory discussion -->
<!-- We are going to respond to the multilevel (or crossed random effects) structure in the data by using linear mixed-effects models to analyze the data. -->
<!-- This week, we are going to look at what mixed-effects models do from a **new perspective**. -->
<!-- Our concern will be with different ways of thinking about why mixed-effects models are superior to linear models where data have a multilevel structure. -->
<!-- Mixed-effects models tend to be more accurate in this (very common) situation because of what is called *partial pooling* and *shrinkage* or *regularization*. -->
<!-- We use our practical example to explore these ideas. -->
<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:no-vs-complete-vs-partial) presents a grid or trellis of plots, one plot per person. -->
<!-- To draw the plot, I adapted code written by TJ Mahr: -->
<!-- <https://www.tjmahr.com/plotting-partial-pooling-in-mixed-effects-models/> -->
<!-- In each plot, you can see points corresponding to the RT of each response made by a participant to a stimulus word. -->
<!-- In all plots, the pink line represents the *complete pooling* data model estimate of the effect of frequency on response RTs. -->
<!-- In each plot, the green line represents the effect of frequency estimated using just the data for each participant, the *no pooling* estimates. -->
<!-- In the plots, we also see blue lines that represent the mixed-effects model *partial pooling* estimates. -->
<!-- ```{r no-vs-complete-vs-partial, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.height=8.5, fig.width=6, out.width='95%', fig.cap="Plot showing the relationship between logRT and log frequency (LgSUBTLCD) separately for each participant; pink line shows the complete pooling estimate green line shows the no-pooling estimate; and blue line shows the linear mixed-effects model partial pooling estimate"} -->

<!-- ### Critical idea -->
<!-- **Shrinkage or regularization** means that models of data should be excited by the data but not *too* excited. -->
<!-- ### Targets -->
<!-- We are probably now at a stage, in the development of our skills and understanding, where we can be more specific about our targets for learning. -->
<!-- We have three components of the capacity we seek to develop. -->
<!-- These components include the capacity to understand mixed-effects models, the capacity to work with them practically in R, and the capacity to present the results. -->
<!-- The development of skills and understanding in relation to each component will travel at different speeds, for different people, and, within any person, at different speeds for different components. -->
<!-- We have *already* begun to develop some of the capacities I outline. -->
<!-- We will strengthen our understanding and our practical skills in the class for which this webpage, and the associated resources, are provided. -->
<!-- And we will will continue to develop both understanding and skills in the next class. -->
<!-- Remember, my advice has been that we should seek to progress in our development step-by-step. -->
<!-- Remember, **we need to be patient with ourselves**. -->
<!-- Our understanding or the extent of our practical capacities will not necessarily match our own internal evaluation. -->
<!-- In other words, we might not be satisfied with our understanding but, still, our understanding might be satisfactory. -->
<!-- I want to remind you that these are challenging materials. -->
<!-- For these reasons, I specify what we are aiming to develop in terms of what we can *do*. -->
<!-- #### We want to develop the capacity to **understand** mixed-effects models -->
<!-- This involves the capacity to: -->
<!-- 1. recognize where data have a multilevel structure; -->
<!-- 2. recognize where multilevel or mixed-effects models are required; -->
<!-- 3. distinguish the elements of a mixed-effects model, including fixed effects and random effects; -->
<!-- 4. be able to explain how random effects can be understood in terms of random differences (or deviations), between groups or classes or individuals, in intercepts or slopes; -->
<!-- 5. be able to explain how random effects can be understood in terms of variances, as a means to account for random differences between groups or classes or individuals in intercepts or slopes; -->
<!-- 6. be able to explain how mixed-effects models work better than linear models, for multilevel structured data, because they take into account variances associated with random differences; -->
<!-- 7.and be able to explain how mixed-effects models work better because they allow partial-pooling of estimates, using both information from the whole data set and information from group or class or individual specific data. -->
<!-- #### We want to develop the capacity to work practically in R with mixed-effects models -->
<!-- This involves the capacity to: -->
<!-- 1. be able to specify a mixed-effects model in `lmer()` code; -->
<!-- 2. be able to identify how the mixed-effects model code varies, depending on the kinds of random effects that are assumed; -->
<!-- 3. be able to identify the elements of the output or results that come from an `lmer()` mixed-effects analysis; -->
<!-- 4. be able to interpret the fixed-effects estimates; -->
<!-- 5. and be able to interpret the random effects estimates, both variance and covariance estimates. -->
<!-- #### We want to develop the capacity to talk about and present the results of mixed-effects models -->
<!-- This involves the capacity to: -->
<!-- 1. be able to describe in words and summary tables the results of a mixed-effects model; -->
<!-- 2. be able to visualize the effects estimates from a mixed-effects model. -->

<!-- ### Lab activity -->
<!-- We will take things step-by-step. -->
<!-- The workbook has three sets of steps: -->
<!-- - First, I show you how to prepare data for analysis -- just run the code and do the exercises; -->
<!-- - Second, I walk through a sequence of tasks where I show you how to fit and compare a series of models -- again, just run the code and do the exercises; -->
<!-- - the critical step is Step 7, where I ask you to follow the examples, running your own series of models but with your selection of variables; -->
<!-- - Third, finally, I show you how to reproduce some of the key plots from the book chapter and slides, this is for your information, if you are interested, and is optional. -->
<!-- ### Tasks -->
<!-- In the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks. -->
<!-- First, I am going to show you **how to prepare data** for analysis. -->
<!-- 1. Load the libraries we need. -->
<!-- 2. Read in the data file -- using the `read_csv()` function. -->
<!-- 3. Plot the distribution of reaction time (RT) observations -- using `geom_density()` and `geom_rug()`. -->
<!-- 4. Take a look at `ggplot()` refernece information and experiment with alternative visualizations. -->
<!-- 5. Filter observations by setting conditions on RT -- using `filter()`. -->
<!-- 6. Check the impact of filtering by counting the number of observations -- using `length()` -->
<!-- 7. Visualize the distribution of the filtered data. -->
<!-- 8. Experiment to examine the impact of setting different thresholds to filter observations -->
<!-- 9. Transform RT -- using `log10()`.  -->
<!-- 10. Visualize the distribution of log10 transformed filtered RTs. -->
<!-- 11. Visualize the distribution of log10 RTs for each individual -- using `facet_wrap` -->
<!-- `write_csv()`, as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:density-per-child). -->
<!-- 12. Experiment with altering the visualization. -->
<!-- 13. Examine what the distributon of RTs looks like for each stimulus item. -->
<!-- ```{r density-per-child, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Distribution of log10 RTs, for each participant in the ML dataset, with participant data shown using density plots, ordered by average logRT per person; the red line indicates the overall mean log RT', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.width=9, fig.height=9} -->
<!-- ML.all.correct <- filter(ML.all, RT >= 200) -->
<!-- ML.all.correct$logrt <- log10(ML.all.correct$RT) -->
<!-- ML.all.correct %>% -->
<!--   mutate(mean_logrt = mean(logrt, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% -->
<!--   ungroup() %>% -->
<!--   mutate(subjectID = fct_reorder(subjectID, mean_logrt)) %>% -->
<!--   ggplot(aes(x = logrt)) + -->
<!--   geom_density(size = 1.25) + -->
<!--   facet_wrap(~ subjectID) + -->
<!--   geom_vline(xintercept = 2.778807, colour = "red", linetype = 2) + -->
<!--   scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2.5,3)) + -->
<!--   ggtitle("Plot showing distribution of logRT for each participant; red line shows mean log10 RT") + -->
<!--   theme_bw() -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Second, I then walk through a sequence of tasks where I show you how to fit and compare a series of models. -->
<!-- 14. Consider a linear model of the effect of word frequency on RT, then examine the impact of other potential predictors. -->
<!-- 15. Fit a linear mixed-effects model to estimate the effect of frequency on log RT while taking into account random effects -- using `lmer()`. -->
<!-- 16. Fit a linear mixed-effects models with varying random effects. -->
<!-- 17. Compare the different models -- using `anova()`. -->
<!-- 18.-19. Examine whether random slopes effects are required. -->
<!-- 20. Get p-values for fixed effects estimates -- using `lmerTest`. -->
<!-- I think the important bit for your development is located in `Step 7: run your own sequence of lmer models` -->
<!-- **Try to run a series of models in which the fixed effects variable is something different i.e. use a different word property, or properties.** -->
<!-- Third, the last section of the workbook shows you how to reproduce the plots in the chapter and slides. -->
<!-- This is optional, and provided for your interest, only. -->
<!-- To produce the plots, I adapted Tristan Mahr's code, from his very useful blogpost (borrowed, with thanks): -->
<!-- <https://www.tjmahr.com/plotting-partial-pooling-in-mixed-effects-models/> -->
<!-- ### The data we will work with: ML -->
<!-- We will be working with the **ML word recognition study** dataset. -->
<!-- The focus of our interest is on the ways in which participant attributes (like age) or word properties (like frequency) influence the speed of response in a task measuring the ability to recognize visually presented English words. -->
<!-- ML examined visual word recognition in younger and older adults using the lexical decision task. -->
<!-- Lexical decision is a very popular technique for examining word recognition, especially in adults.  -->
<!-- While not every Psychology student will be interested in word recognition, or reading, everyone should understand that tasks like lexical decision are similar to a range of other tasks used in experimental psychological science. -->
<!-- The critical features of the study are that we have an outcome -- a decision response -- observed multiple times (for each stimulus) for each participant.  -->
<!-- We shall be analyzing the speed of response, reaction time (RT), measured in milliseconds (ms). -->
<!-- In the lexical decision task, participants completed a series of 320 trials. -->
<!-- In each trial, they were presented with a stimulus, a string of letters, that was either a real word (e.g., 'car') or a made-up or non-word (e.g., 'cas'). -->
<!-- There were 160 word and 160 non-word stimuli. -->
<!-- Each stimulus was presented one at a time on a computer screen. -->
<!-- Participants were required to respond to the stimulus by pressing a button to indicate either that they thought the stimulus was a word (they knew) or that they thought it was a non-word. -->
<!-- Each sequence of events, in which a stimulus was presented and a response was recorded, is known as a *trial*. -->
<!-- The critical outcome measure was the reaction time of each response: the interval of time from the moment the stimulus was first presented (the stimulus onset) to the moment the response was made (the response onset). -->
<!-- The total number of participants for this study was 39, including a group of younger adults and a group of older adults. -->
<!-- Information was collected about the participants' age, education and gender. -->
<!-- In addition, participants were asked to complete ability measures (TOWRE sight word and phonemic tests, Torgesen et al., 1999) and a measure of reading experience (Author Recognition Test, ART, Masterson \& Hayes, 2007). -->
<!-- In summary, ML collected data on: lexical decision task response reaction times (RTs) and accuracy; information on lexical decision stimulus items, including variables like the length or frequency of words (values taken from the English Lexicon Project, Balota et al., 2007); and information on participants, including age, reading ability and reading experience. -->
<!-- The ML study data includes the following variables that we will work with (as well as some you can ignore). -->
<!-- More information about the study, and the research context for the study, including the research questions, can be found in the book chapter. -->
<!-- *Identifying variables* -->
<!-- * `subjectID` -- identifying code for participants -->
<!-- * `item_name` -- words presented as stimuli -->
<!-- * `item_number` -- identifying code for words presented -->
<!-- *Response variables* -->
<!-- * `RT` -- response reaction time (ms), for responses to words -->
<!-- *Subject variables* -->
<!-- * `Age` -- in years -->
<!-- * `Gender` -- coded M (male), F (female) -->
<!-- * `TOWRE_wordacc` -- word reading skill, words read correctly (out of 104) -->
<!-- * `TOWRE_nonwordacc` -- nonword reading skill, nonwords (made up words) read correctly (out of 63) -->
<!-- * `ART_HRminusFR` -- reading experience score -->
<!-- *Item variables* -->
<!-- * `Length` -- word length, in letters -->
<!-- * `Ortho_N` -- orthographic neighbourhood size, how many other words in English a stimulus word looks like -->
<!-- * `OLD` -- orthographic Levenshtein distance, how many letter edits (addition, deletion or substitution) it would take to make a stimulus word look like another English word (a measure of orthographic neighbourhood) (Yarkoni et al., 2008) -->
<!-- * `BG_Sum, BG_Mean, BG_Freq_By_Pos` -- measures of how common are pairs of letters that compose stimulus words -->
<!-- * `SUBTLWF, LgSUBTLWF, SUBTLCD, LgSUBTLCD` -- measures of how common stimulus words are, taken from the SUBTLEX corpus analysis of word frequency (Brysbaert and New, 2009) -->
