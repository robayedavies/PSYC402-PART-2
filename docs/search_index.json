As we saw in the Introduction to mixed-effects models (for the 02-mixed class), many Psychologists conduct studies where it is not sensible to think of observations as being nested (Baayen, Davidson, &amp; Bates, 2008). We shall work with the ML word recognition study dataset, which has a structure similar to the CP study data that we worked with previously. Again, the core concern is that the data come from a study with a repeated-measures design where the experimenter presented multiple stimuli for response to each participant, for several participants, so that we have multiple observations for each participant and multiple observations for each stimulus. Getting practice with this kind of data will help you to easily recognize what you have got when you see it in your own work. We shall analyse the outcome variable in relation to: In this webpage, I extract and present an outline taster summary (a little re-ordered) of a second chapter written for the course. Please go to the chapter for the authoritative version of the full text: 03-mixed.pdf. 4.1.1 Introductory discussion 4.1.2 Critical idea 4.1.3 Targets We are probably now at a stage, in the development of our skills and understanding, where we can be more specific about our targets for learning. We have three components of the capacity we seek to develop. These components include the capacity to understand mixed-effects models, the capacity to work with them practically in R, and the capacity to present the results. The development of skills and understanding in relation to each component will travel at different speeds, for different people, and, within any person, at different speeds for different components. We have already begun to develop some of the capacities I outline. We will strengthen our understanding and our practical skills in the class for which this webpage, and the associated resources, are provided. And we will will continue to develop both understanding and skills in the next class. Remember, my advice has been that we should seek to progress in our development step-by-step. Remember, we need to be patient with ourselves. Our understanding or the extent of our practical capacities will not necessarily match our own internal evaluation. In other words, we might not be satisfied with our understanding but, still, our understanding might be satisfactory. I want to remind you that these are challenging materials. For these reasons, I specify what we are aiming to develop in terms of what we can do. 4.1.3.1 We want to develop the capacity to understand mixed-effects models This involves the capacity to: recognize where data have a multilevel structure; recognize where multilevel or mixed-effects models are required; distinguish the elements of a mixed-effects model, including fixed effects and random effects; be able to explain how random effects can be understood in terms of random differences (or deviations), between groups or classes or individuals, in intercepts or slopes; be able to explain how random effects can be understood in terms of variances, as a means to account for random differences between groups or classes or individuals in intercepts or slopes; be able to explain how mixed-effects models work better than linear models, for multilevel structured data, because they take into account variances associated with random differences; 7.and be able to explain how mixed-effects models work better because they allow partial-pooling of estimates, using both information from the whole data set and information from group or class or individual specific data. 4.1.3.2 We want to develop the capacity to work practically in R with mixed-effects models This involves the capacity to: be able to specify a mixed-effects model in lmer() code; be able to identify how the mixed-effects model code varies, depending on the kinds of random effects that are assumed; be able to identify the elements of the output or results that come from an lmer() mixed-effects analysis; be able to interpret the fixed-effects estimates; and be able to interpret the random effects estimates, both variance and covariance estimates. 4.1.3.3 We want to develop the capacity to talk about and present the results of mixed-effects models This involves the capacity to: be able to describe in words and summary tables the results of a mixed-effects model; be able to visualize the effects estimates from a mixed-effects model. 4.2 Resources for you You will see – below – links to the lectures, information about the data we will analyze, and an explanation of the activities. The links and everything you need for your practical work class can also be found in the Week 19 folder on Moodle, here: Link to Moodle I have prepared materials that I suggest you use in this order: Before the lab session Take a look at the lecture slides, watch the lecture video. The lecture is designed to work only as an outline summary of the materials. Learning will work best if you read the book chapter I wrote on the topic, and work through the exercises in the workbook.R Read the book chapter, to develop understanding. Download the week 18 files, and work your way throught the workbook.R, guided by the book chapter, at least as far as reading in the data and tidying it for analysis. In the session Work through the workbook.R, complete the tasks and answer the questions, in groups, guided by the code tips and the information in the chapter. After the session Bring your questions to the Q&amp;A session or post questions to the discussion forum. Be patient with yourself and with the materials. The topic is challenging because it is new but it is very important. The plan is to build up understanding and analysis skill step by step. 4.2.1 Lectures: video recordings The lecture material for this week is presented in three parts. Click on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part. (You will need to be on campus or logged in to the university VPN to get access to the videos.) Part 1 of 3 Part 2 of 3 Part 3 of 3 4.2.2 Book chapter I wrote a book chapter to support PSYC402 student learning. You can download the chapter here 03-mixed.pdf. The chapter is useful to you in two ways: I use text and visualization to explain the core ideas in depth; I take you through each part of the code that you need to use, step-by-step, for your development of practical skills in data tidying, visualization, and analysis. 4.2.3 Pre-lab activity 1: Get your files ready for the lab class Activities in the class that goes with this chapter are associated with the following data file: subjects.behaviour.words-310114.csv And the .R code file: 402-03-mixed-effects-workbook.R You will use 402-03-mixed-effects-workbook.R in the lab activity. 4.2.4 Lab activity We will take things step-by-step. We will split .R scripts into parts, tasks and questions: different parts for different phases of the analysis workflow; different tasks for different steps in each phase; different questions to examine different ideas or coding steps. 4.2.5 Tasks In the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks. First, I am going to show you how to put together, tidy, and prepare for analysis the kind of data you can expect to record or receive when you do a psychological experiment. You can skip the tasks in this part but checking the steps out will save you a lot of time if you are going to work with primary or original (i.e. raw and thus messy) data in your dissertation or in your future professional work. Load the libraries we need Read in the data files we will be using – using variants of the read_() function Restructure behavioural (response) data – using pivot_longer() Join data from different sources – using full_join() Select just the variables you need – using select() Filter observations by setting different kinds of conditions – using filter() Remove missing values – using na.omit() Produce an Excel-readable and shareable version of the tidied prepared dataset – using write_csv() Second, we work on our understanding and practical skills in modeling multilevel structured data. This part is essential to your attainment of our learning objectives. Read in the pre-prepared data – using read_csv() and defining col_types as we do so Visualizing effects with scatterplots – using geom_point() and geom_smooth() Modeling effects while ignoring grouping – using lm() Visualizing how effects may differ between groups (here, between participants) – using facet_wrap() Fitting linear mixed-effects models – using lmer() Learning to fit mixed-effects models with different kinds of random effects structure, examining the impact of these differences in structure Taking into account random effects associated with differences between participants, as well as differences between stimuli In the answers version of the workbook, I will provide optional extension exercises you can use to develop your coding skills, showing how I produced the plots in the slides and the book chapter. 4.2.6 The data we will work with: ML 4.3 References "]]
