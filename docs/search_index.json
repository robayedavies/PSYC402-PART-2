Our plan will be to build depth and breadth in understanding as we progress over the next few weeks. 3.2 Resources for you You will see – below – links to the lectures, information about the data we will analyze, and an explanation of the activities. The links and everything you need for your practical work class can also be found in the Week 16 files folder on Moodle, here: Link to Moodle Our aim is to get started in our development of understanding how to use multilevel of mixed-effects models: we need to learn what they are, when and why they are needed, and how they should be used. I have prepared materials that I suggest you use in this order: Before the lab session Take a look at the lecture slides, watch the lecture video. The lecture is designed to work only as an outline summary of the materials. Learning will work best if you read the book chapter I wrote on the topic, and work through the exercises in the workbook.R Read the book chapter, at least up to p.11, to get an outline view on the answers to the what, why, when and how questions on multilevel models. Download the week 16 files, and work your way throught the workbook.R, guided by the book chapter, at least as far as reading in the data and tidying it for analysis. In the session Work through the workbook.R, complete the tasks and answer the questions, in groups, guided by the code tips and the information in the chapter. After the session Bring your questions to the Q&amp;A session or post questions to the discussion forum. Be patient with yourself and with the materials. The topic is challenging because it is new but it is very important. The plan is to build up understanding and analysis skill step by step. 3.2.1 Lectures: video recordings The lecture material for this week is presented in three parts. Click on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part. (You will need to be on campus or logged in to the university VPN to get access to the videos.) Part 1 of 3 Part 2 of 3 Part 3 of 3 3.2.2 Book chapter I wrote a book chapter to support PSYC402 students learning about multilevel models. You can download the chapter here 02-mixed.pdf. 3.2.3 Pre-lab activity 1: Get your files ready for the lab class Activities in the class that goes with this chapter are associated with the following data files: CP study word naming rt 180211.dat CP study word naming acc 180211.dat words.items.5 120714 150916.csv all.subjects 110614-050316-290518.csv And the .R code file: 402-02-mixed-effects-workbook.R A pre-tidied version of the CP study data is available as: long.all.noNAs.csv You will use 402-02-mixed-effects-workbook.R in the lab activity. 3.2.4 Lab activity We will take things step-by-step. We will split .R scripts into parts, tasks and questions: different parts for different phases of the analysis workflow; different tasks for different steps in each phase; different questions to examine different ideas or coding steps. 3.2.5 Tasks In the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks. Load the libraries we need for the exercises Read in the data file we will be using: BAFACALO_DATASET.RData We start by selecting the variables we want – using select() Take missing values out of the brazil data – using na.omit() Get R to treat a variable as a type object of the kind required – using the as.numeric() or as.factor() functions Experiment with variable coercion Visualize the relationship between portuguese and english grades using a scatterplot Work on editing plots Analyze the relationship between english and portuguese grades in the brazil data – using lm() Exercise: adapt the lm() code to do a different analysis Plot the relationship between english and portuguese grades separately for each class using facet_wrap Practice your facet_wrap() skills Run a linear mixed-effects analysis of the relationship between english and portuguese grades using lmer() Exercise mixed-effects model coding There are some extension exercises you can use to develop your coding skills. 3.2.6 The data we will work with: Brazilian school children We will be working with data taken from a study on education outcomes in Brazilian children, reported by Golina and Gomes (2014). The BAFACALO_DATASET.RData data were collected and shared online by Golina and Gomes (2014). Information about the background motivating the study, the methods of data collection, along with the dataset itself, can be found in the book chapter, and at the data journal article: Golina and Gomes (2014) article 3.3 References Golino, H.
