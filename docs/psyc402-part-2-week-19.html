<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to our overview of the materials and guidance you will work with in <strong>PSYC402 Week 19</strong> for the <strong>03-mixed</strong> class.</p>
<p>As we saw in the <strong>Introduction to mixed-effects models</strong> (for the <code>02-mixed</code> class), many Psychologists conduct studies where it is not sensible to think of observations as being nested (Baayen, Davidson, &amp; Bates, 2008).
We shall work with the <strong>ML word recognition study</strong> dataset, which has a structure similar to the CP study data that we worked with previously.
Again, the core concern is that the data come from a study with a <strong>repeated-measures design</strong> where the experimenter presented multiple stimuli for response to each participant, for several participants, so that we have multiple observations for each participant and multiple observations for each stimulus.
Getting practice with this kind of data will help you to easily recognize what you have got when you see it in your own work.</p>
<p>We shall analyse the outcome variable in relation to:</p>
<p>In this webpage, I extract and present an outline taster summary (a little re-ordered) of a second chapter written for the course.
Please go to the chapter for the authoritative version of the full text: <a href="files/week-19/03-mixed.pdf">03-mixed.pdf</a>.</p>
<div id="introductory-discussion-1" class="section level3" number="4.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Introductory discussion</h3>
<!-- Many psychological studies involve scenarios in which the researcher samples both participants and some kind of stimulus (e.g., words, pictures, sounds, stories ...) -->
<!-- Often, the researcher will present the stimuli to the participants for response in some version of a range of possible designs:  -->
<!-- - all participants see and respond to all stimuli;  -->
<!-- - participants respond to different sub-sets of stimuli in different conditions (or in different groups) but they see and respond to all stimuli in a sub-set;  -->
<!-- - participants are allocated to respond to stimulus sub-sets according to a counter balancing scheme (e.g., through the use of Latin squares). -->
<!-- We are talking, here, about **repeated-measures designs** where the experimenter presents a sample of multiple stimuli for response to each participant in a sample of multiple participants. -->
<!-- Whatever version of this scenario, *if* participants are responding to multiple stimuli and *if* multiple participants respond to each stimulus, then the data will have a *multilevel structure* such that each observation can be grouped both by participant and by stimulus. -->
<!-- We could say that observations of the responses made by participants to each stimulus can be grouped by participant: each person will tend to respond in similar ways to different stimuli; and we will see differences between participants. -->
<!-- Or, we could say that observations of responses can be grouped by stimulus because each stimulus will tend to evoke similar kinds of responses in different people; and we will see differences between the responses made to different stimuli. -->
<!-- The differences between the sets (or groups) of responses made by different participants (between participants differences) and the differences between the sets of responses made to different stimuli (between stimulus differences) may be unexplained or random differences. -->
<!-- **The multilevel structure requires that we use multilevel or mixed-effects models to analyse our data.** -->
<!-- We are going to learn about an approach in which we take into account the unexplained or random differences between participants *and* between stimuli. -->
<!-- A substantial portion of our conceptual development will now begin, with a deepening in our perspective on the impact of random differences between participants or stimuli, which we shall discuss in terms of *random effects*. -->
<!-- We shall extend our practical skills by learning how to specify these random effects in different ways using the `lmer()` function. -->
<!-- We will learn to fit models that can effectively handle the fact that we may observe responses from participants who not only differ in their average level of performance (differ in intercepts, if we control for the effects of covariates) but differ also in their response to experimental variables (differ in slopes). -->
<!-- Our work, here, will build on the work we did in the previous class. -->
<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:freqperchildlm) presents estimates of the intercept and the effect of an experimental variable (word frequency) for each participant in our example dataset, with plot points shown ordered by the size of the estimate. -->
<!-- We will learn to fit models that can *also* handle the fact that, as is often true in psychological research, we may observe responses that are made to stimuli which will present random differences as well (in relative difficulty, say). -->
<!-- For example, some words elicit slower and some elicit faster responses on average (Figure \@ref(fig:pitemsints)). -->
<!-- In a further extension of our understanding, located especially in the chapter reading, we will develop our conceptual grasp of multilevel or mixed effects models by considering carefully what we estimate when we estimate random effects. -->
<!-- We will discuss the ways in which the random effects structure of multilevel or mixed-effects models can vary, and what impact that variation may have, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:indiv-prediction). -->
</div>
<div id="critical-idea-1" class="section level3" number="4.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Critical idea</h3>
<!-- The critical idea is that, in general, in experimental psychological science, when we do data analysis, *if* we want to estimate effects of experimental variables more accurately *then* our models need to incorporate terms to capture the impact on observed outcomes of variation among sampled participants and among sampled stimuli. -->
<!-- Historically, we have, as a field, learned that we must take these sampling effects into account. -->
<!-- More and more commonly, we are learning to use multilevel or mixed-effects models to do this. -->
</div>
<div id="targets-2" class="section level3" number="4.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Targets</h3>
<p>We are probably now at a stage, in the development of our skills and understanding, where we can be more specific about our targets for learning.
We have three components of the capacity we seek to develop.
These components include the capacity to understand mixed-effects models, the capacity to work with them practically in R, and the capacity to present the results.</p>
<p>The development of skills and understanding in relation to each component will travel at different speeds, for different people, and, within any person, at different speeds for different components.
We have <em>already</em> begun to develop some of the capacities I outline.
We will strengthen our understanding and our practical skills in the class for which this webpage, and the associated resources, are provided.
And we will will continue to develop both understanding and skills in the next class.</p>
<p>Remember, my advice has been that we should seek to progress in our development step-by-step.
Remember, <strong>we need to be patient with ourselves</strong>.
Our understanding or the extent of our practical capacities will not necessarily match our own internal evaluation.
In other words, we might not be satisfied with our understanding but, still, our understanding might be satisfactory.
I want to remind you that these are challenging materials.
For these reasons, I specify what we are aiming to develop in terms of what we can <em>do</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Book chapter</h3>
<p>I wrote a book chapter to support PSYC402 student learning.</p>
<p>You can download the chapter here <a href="files/week-19/03-mixed.pdf">03-mixed.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>The chapter is useful to you in two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I use text and visualization to explain the core ideas in depth;</li>
<li>I take you through each part of the code that you need to use, step-by-step, for your development of practical skills in data tidying, visualization, and analysis.</li>
</ol>

<div id="pre-lab-activity-1-get-your-files-ready-for-the-lab-class-2" class="section level3" number="4.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Pre-lab activity 1: Get your files ready for the lab class</h3>
<p>Activities in the class that goes with this chapter are associated with the following data file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>subjects.behaviour.words-310114.csv</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And the .R code file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>402-03-mixed-effects-workbook.R</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You will use <code>402-03-mixed-effects-workbook.R</code> in the lab activity.</p>
</div>
<div id="lab-activity-2" class="section level3" number="4.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> Lab activity</h3>
<p>We will take things step-by-step.</p>
<p>The workbook has three sets of steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I show you how to prepare data for analysis – just run the code and do the exercises;</li>
<li>Second, I walk through a sequence of tasks where I show you how to fit and compare a series of models – again, just run the code and do the exercises;</li>
<li>the critical step is Step 7, where I ask you to follow the examples, running your own series of models but with your selection of variables;</li>
<li>Third, finally, I show you how to reproduce some of the key plots from the book chapter and slides, this is for your information, if you are interested, and is optional.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tasks-2" class="section level3" number="4.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.5</span> Tasks</h3>
<p>In the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks.</p>
<p>First, I am going to show you <strong>how to prepare data</strong> for analysis.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Load the libraries we need.</li>
<li>Read in the data file – using the <code>read_csv()</code> function.</li>
<li>Plot the distribution of reaction time (RT) observations – using <code>geom_density()</code> and <code>geom_rug()</code>.</li>
<li>Take a look at <code>ggplot()</code> refernece information and experiment with alternative visualizations.</li>
<li>Filter observations by setting conditions on RT – using <code>filter()</code>.</li>
<li>Check the impact of filtering by counting the number of observations – using <code>length()</code></li>
<li>Visualize the distribution of the filtered data.</li>
<li>Experiment to examine the impact of setting different thresholds to filter observations</li>
<li>Transform RT – using <code>log10()</code>.</li>
<li>Visualize the distribution of log10 transformed filtered RTs.</li>
<li>Visualize the distribution of log10 RTs for each individual – using <code>facet_wrap</code>
<code>write_csv()</code>, as seen in Figure <a href="psyc402-part-2-week-19.html#fig:density-per-child">4.1</a>.</li>
<li>Experiment with altering the visualization.</li>
<li>Examine what the distributon of RTs looks like for each stimulus item.</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:density-per-child"></span>
<img src="03-PSYC402-03-mixed_files/figure-html/density-per-child-1.png" alt="Distribution of log10 RTs, for each participant in the ML dataset, with participant data shown using density plots, ordered by average logRT per person; the red line indicates the overall mean log RT" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Second, I then walk through a sequence of tasks where I show you how to fit and compare a series of models.</p>
<ol start="14" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Consider a linear model of the effect of word frequency on RT, then examine the impact of other potential predictors.</li>
<li>Fit a linear mixed-effects model to estimate the effect of frequency on log RT while taking into account random effects – using <code>lmer()</code>.</li>
<li>Fit a linear mixed-effects models with varying random effects.</li>
<li>Compare the different models – using <code>anova()</code>.
18.-19. Examine whether random slopes effects are required.</li>
<li>Get p-values for fixed effects estimates – using <code>lmerTest</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the important bit for your development is located in <code>Step 7: run your own sequence of lmer models</code></p>
<p><strong>Try to run a series of models in which the fixed effects variable is something different i.e. use a different word property, or properties.</strong></p>
<p>Third, the last section of the workbook shows you how to reproduce the plots in the chapter and slides.
This is optional, and provided for your interest, only.</p>
<p>To produce the plots, I adapted Tristan Mahr’s code, from his very useful blogpost (borrowed, with thanks):

<div id="the-data-we-will-work-with-ml" class="section level3" number="4.2.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.6</span> The data we will work with: ML</h3>
<p>We will be working with the <strong>ML word recognition study</strong> dataset.
The focus of our interest is on the ways in which participant attributes (like age) or word properties (like frequency) influence the speed of response in a task measuring the ability to recognize visually presented English words.</p>
<p>ML examined visual word recognition in younger and older adults using the lexical decision task.
Lexical decision is a very popular technique for examining word recognition, especially in adults.
While not every Psychology student will be interested in word recognition, or reading, everyone should understand that tasks like lexical decision are similar to a range of other tasks used in experimental psychological science.
The critical features of the study are that we have an outcome – a decision response – observed multiple times (for each stimulus) for each participant.
We shall be analyzing the speed of response, reaction time (RT), measured in milliseconds (ms).</p>
<p>In the lexical decision task, participants completed a series of 320 trials.
In each trial, they were presented with a stimulus, a string of letters, that was either a real word (e.g., ‘car’) or a made-up or non-word (e.g., ‘cas’).
There were 160 word and 160 non-word stimuli.
Each stimulus was presented one at a time on a computer screen.
Participants were required to respond to the stimulus by pressing a button to indicate either that they thought the stimulus was a word (they knew) or that they thought it was a non-word.
Each sequence of events, in which a stimulus was presented and a response was recorded, is known as a <em>trial</em>.
The critical outcome measure was the reaction time of each response: the interval of time from the moment the stimulus was first presented (the stimulus onset) to the moment the response was made (the response onset).</p>
<p>The total number of participants for this study was 39, including a group of younger adults and a group of older adults.
Information was collected about the participants’ age, education and gender.
In addition, participants were asked to complete ability measures (TOWRE sight word and phonemic tests, Torgesen et al., 1999) and a measure of reading experience (Author Recognition Test, ART, Masterson &amp; Hayes, 2007).</p>
<p>In summary, ML collected data on: lexical decision task response reaction times (RTs) and accuracy; information on lexical decision stimulus items, including variables like the length or frequency of words (values taken from the English Lexicon Project, Balota et al., 2007); and information on participants, including age, reading ability and reading experience.</p>
<p>The ML study data includes the following variables that we will work with (as well as some you can ignore).
More information about the study, and the research context for the study, including the research questions, can be found in the book chapter.</p>
<p><em>Identifying variables</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>subjectID</code> – identifying code for participants</li>
<li><code>item_name</code> – words presented as stimuli</li>
<li><code>item_number</code> – identifying code for words presented</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Response variables</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>RT</code> – response reaction time (ms), for responses to words</li>

<li><code>ART_HRminusFR</code> – reading experience score</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Item variables</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Length</code> – word length, in letters</p></li>

<li><p><code>OLD</code> – orthographic Levenshtein distance, how many letter edits (addition, deletion or substitution) it would take to make a stimulus word look like another English word (a measure of orthographic neighbourhood) (Yarkoni et al., 2008)</p></li>
<li><p><code>BG_Sum, BG_Mean, BG_Freq_By_Pos</code> – measures of how common are pairs of letters that compose stimulus words</p></li>
<li><p><code>SUBTLWF, LgSUBTLWF,  SUBTLCD, LgSUBTLCD</code> – measures of how common stimulus words are, taken from the SUBTLEX corpus analysis of word frequency (Brysbaert and New, 2009)</p></li>
