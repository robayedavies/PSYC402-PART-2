<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to our overview of the materials and guidance you will work with in <strong>PSYC402 Week 19</strong> for the <strong>03-mixed</strong> class.</p>
<p>As we saw in the <strong>Introduction to mixed-effects models</strong> (for the <code>02-mixed</code> class), many Psychologists conduct studies where it is not sensible to think of observations as being nested (Baayen, Davidson, &amp; Bates, 2008).
We shall work with the <strong>ML word recognition study</strong> dataset, which has a structure similar to the CP study data that we worked with previously.
Again, the core concern is that the data come from a study with a <strong>repeated-measures design</strong> where the experimenter presented multiple stimuli for response to each participant, for several participants, so that we have multiple observations for each participant and multiple observations for each stimulus.
Getting practice with this kind of data will help you to easily recognize what you have got when you see it in your own work.</p>
<p>We shall analyse the outcome variable in relation to:</p>
<p>In this webpage, I extract and present an outline taster summary (a little re-ordered) of a second chapter written for the course.
Please go to the chapter for the authoritative version of the full text: <a href="files/week-19/03-mixed.pdf">03-mixed.pdf</a>.</p>
<div id="introductory-discussion-1" class="section level3" number="4.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Introductory discussion</h3>
<!-- Many psychological studies involve scenarios in which the researcher samples both participants and some kind of stimulus (e.g., words, pictures, sounds, stories ...) -->
<!-- Often, the researcher will present the stimuli to the participants for response in some version of a range of possible designs:  -->
<!-- - all participants see and respond to all stimuli;  -->
<!-- - participants respond to different sub-sets of stimuli in different conditions (or in different groups) but they see and respond to all stimuli in a sub-set;  -->
<!-- - participants are allocated to respond to stimulus sub-sets according to a counter balancing scheme (e.g., through the use of Latin squares). -->
<!-- We are talking, here, about **repeated-measures designs** where the experimenter presents a sample of multiple stimuli for response to each participant in a sample of multiple participants. -->
<!-- Whatever version of this scenario, *if* participants are responding to multiple stimuli and *if* multiple participants respond to each stimulus, then the data will have a *multilevel structure* such that each observation can be grouped both by participant and by stimulus. -->
<!-- We could say that observations of the responses made by participants to each stimulus can be grouped by participant: each person will tend to respond in similar ways to different stimuli; and we will see differences between participants. -->
<!-- Or, we could say that observations of responses can be grouped by stimulus because each stimulus will tend to evoke similar kinds of responses in different people; and we will see differences between the responses made to different stimuli. -->
<!-- The differences between the sets (or groups) of responses made by different participants (between participants differences) and the differences between the sets of responses made to different stimuli (between stimulus differences) may be unexplained or random differences. -->
<!-- **The multilevel structure requires that we use multilevel or mixed-effects models to analyse our data.** -->
<!-- We are going to learn about an approach in which we take into account the unexplained or random differences between participants *and* between stimuli. -->
<!-- A substantial portion of our conceptual development will now begin, with a deepening in our perspective on the impact of random differences between participants or stimuli, which we shall discuss in terms of *random effects*. -->
<!-- We shall extend our practical skills by learning how to specify these random effects in different ways using the `lmer()` function. -->
<!-- We will learn to fit models that can effectively handle the fact that we may observe responses from participants who not only differ in their average level of performance (differ in intercepts, if we control for the effects of covariates) but differ also in their response to experimental variables (differ in slopes). -->
<!-- Our work, here, will build on the work we did in the previous class. -->
<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:freqperchildlm) presents estimates of the intercept and the effect of an experimental variable (word frequency) for each participant in our example dataset, with plot points shown ordered by the size of the estimate. -->
<!-- We will learn to fit models that can *also* handle the fact that, as is often true in psychological research, we may observe responses that are made to stimuli which will present random differences as well (in relative difficulty, say). -->
<!-- For example, some words elicit slower and some elicit faster responses on average (Figure \@ref(fig:pitemsints)). -->
<!-- In a further extension of our understanding, located especially in the chapter reading, we will develop our conceptual grasp of multilevel or mixed effects models by considering carefully what we estimate when we estimate random effects. -->
<!-- We will discuss the ways in which the random effects structure of multilevel or mixed-effects models can vary, and what impact that variation may have, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:indiv-prediction). -->
</div>
<div id="critical-idea-1" class="section level3" number="4.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Critical idea</h3>
<!-- The critical idea is that, in general, in experimental psychological science, when we do data analysis, *if* we want to estimate effects of experimental variables more accurately *then* our models need to incorporate terms to capture the impact on observed outcomes of variation among sampled participants and among sampled stimuli. -->
<!-- Historically, we have, as a field, learned that we must take these sampling effects into account. -->
<!-- More and more commonly, we are learning to use multilevel or mixed-effects models to do this. -->
</div>
<div id="targets-2" class="section level3" number="4.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Targets</h3>
<p>We are probably now at a stage, in the development of our skills and understanding, where we can be more specific about our targets for learning.
We have three components of the capacity we seek to develop.
These components include the capacity to understand mixed-effects models, the capacity to work with them practically in R, and the capacity to present the results.</p>
<p>The development of skills and understanding in relation to each component will travel at different speeds, for different people, and, within any person, at different speeds for different components.
We have <em>already</em> begun to develop some of the capacities I outline.
We will strengthen our understanding and our practical skills in the class for which this webpage, and the associated resources, are provided.
And we will will continue to develop both understanding and skills in the next class.</p>
<p>Remember, my advice has been that we should seek to progress in our development step-by-step.
Remember, <strong>we need to be patient with ourselves</strong>.
Our understanding or the extent of our practical capacities will not necessarily match our own internal evaluation.
In other words, we might not be satisfied with our understanding but, still, our understanding might be satisfactory.
I want to remind you that these are challenging materials.
For these reasons, I specify what we are aiming to develop in terms of what we can <em>do</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Book chapter</h3>
<p>I wrote a book chapter to support PSYC402 student learning.</p>
<p>You can download the chapter here <a href="files/week-19/03-mixed.pdf">03-mixed.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>The chapter is useful to you in two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I use text and visualization to explain the core ideas in depth;</li>
<li>I take you through each part of the code that you need to use, step-by-step, for your development of practical skills in data tidying, visualization, and analysis.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="pre-lab-activity-1-get-your-files-ready-for-the-lab-class-2" class="section level3" number="4.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Pre-lab activity 1: Get your files ready for the lab class</h3>
<p>Activities in the class that goes with this chapter are associated with the following data file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>subjects.behaviour.words-310114.csv</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And the .R code file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>402-03-mixed-effects-workbook.R</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You will use <code>402-03-mixed-effects-workbook.R</code> in the lab activity.</p>
</div>
<div id="lab-activity-2" class="section level3" number="4.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> Lab activity</h3>
<p>We will take things step-by-step.
We will split .R scripts into parts, tasks and questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>different parts for different phases of the analysis workflow;</li>
<li>different tasks for different steps in each phase;</li>
<li>different questions to examine different ideas or coding steps.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tasks-2" class="section level3" number="4.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.5</span> Tasks</h3>
<p>In the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks.</p>
<p>First, I am going to show you <strong>how to put together, tidy, and prepare</strong> for analysis the kind of data you can expect to record or receive when you do a psychological experiment.
You can skip the tasks in this part but checking the steps out will save you a lot of time if you are going to work with primary or original (i.e. raw and thus messy) data in your dissertation or in your future professional work.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Load the libraries we need</li>
<li>Read in the data files we will be using – using variants of the <code>read_()</code> function</li>
<li>Restructure behavioural (response) data – using <code>pivot_longer()</code></li>
<li>Join data from different sources – using <code>full_join()</code></li>
<li>Select just the variables you need – using <code>select()</code></li>
<li>Filter observations by setting different kinds of conditions – using <code>filter()</code></li>
<li>Remove missing values – using <code>na.omit()</code></li>
<li>Produce an Excel-readable and shareable version of the tidied <em>prepared</em> dataset – using <code>write_csv()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Second, we work on our understanding and practical skills in modeling multilevel structured data.
This part <em>is</em> essential to your attainment of our learning objectives.</p>
<ol start="9" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read in the pre-prepared data – using <code>read_csv()</code> and defining <code>col_types</code> as we do so</li>
<li>Visualizing effects with scatterplots – using <code>geom_point()</code> and <code>geom_smooth()</code></li>
<li>Modeling effects while ignoring grouping – using <code>lm()</code></li>
<li>Visualizing how effects may differ between groups (here, between participants) – using <code>facet_wrap()</code></li>
<li>Fitting linear mixed-effects models – using <code>lmer()</code></li>
<li>Learning to fit mixed-effects models with different kinds of random effects structure, examining the impact of these differences in structure</li>
<li>Taking into account random effects associated with differences between participants, as well as differences between stimuli</li>
</ol>
<p>In the answers version of the workbook, I will provide optional extension exercises you can use to develop your coding skills, showing how I produced the plots in the slides and the book chapter.</p>
